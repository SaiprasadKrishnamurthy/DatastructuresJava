# DatastructuresJava
Simple data structures puzzlers in Java8 backed by some cool spock tests.
My aim was not to implement these data structures. But to refresh the brain cells with a few little interesting puzzles and to
evaluate spock as a test specification framework to be used in my opensource & side projects.

## LinkedLists
    * Create from an array.
    * ToString representation.
    * nth element (both forwards and backwards)
    * Size
    * Mid element.
    * Equality of 2 linked lists.
    * Reverse iterative.
    * Reverse recursive.
    * Swap adjacent pairs.

## Stacks
    * Paranthesis checker
    * Infix to Postfix
    * Postfix evaluator
    * Min element of stack
## Queues

## Binary Search Trees

## Heaps
